# Servo Starters

This repo holds the source to a page which helps new contributors identify
introductory Servo issues. If you have a problem with Servo itself, please
[file a bug there](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/new).

## Installing dependencies

NPM is used to manage testing dependencies. `npm install` is required if you
are going to run the tests.

## Running JS Hint

To try and enforce good JS practice, please ensure that running `npm test`
passes when making changes to the codebase.
